As Europe reaches record temperatures, fire services across the continent are fighting to control huge wildfires in countries including Spain, Portugal and France, with hundreds of deaths blamed on soaring heat that scientists say is consistent with climate change. In Spain, helicopters dropped water on the flames as temperatures rose above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) while in France, wildfires have now spread over 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) in the southwestern region of Gironde, and more than 14,000 people have been evacuated, regional authorities said on Sunday afternoon. With the heat wave set to continue into the coming week fire services remain on red alert.
