New York (CNN Business)Google narrowly missed Wall Street analysts' expectations for both sales and profits during the three months ended June 30. But apparently investors felt things could be worse. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) rose more than 2% in after-hours trading Tuesday following the report. The company posted revenues of $69.7 billion during the quarter, an increase of 13% from the prior-year quarter, compared to the $69.9 billion analysts had projected. Net income for the quarter fell more than 13% year-over-year to $16 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $17.3 billion. Sales from Google's core advertising business grew 11.6% year-over-year to $56 billion. But it marked a significant slowdown in growth rate from the same quarter last year, during which it posted a nearly 69% increase in ad revenue as it benefited from a pandemic boom in online advertising. The ad sales slowdown is not a surprise. Snap (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR) last week reported disappointing earnings reports, which they attributed in part to shrinking ad budgets as companies grapple with inflation and recession fears. Google earlier this month said it plans to slow its pace of hiring and rethink investments for the remainder of this year amid the market downturn and economic uncertainty.
