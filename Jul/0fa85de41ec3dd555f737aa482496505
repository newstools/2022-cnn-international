(CNN)Latin boy band Menudo is eyeing a return with a new generation of talent, and Mario Lopez is lending a hand in the search. After a 12-year break, Menudo Productions announced the launch of a global talent search to find the next iteration of the vocal group that helped launch Ricky Martin to fame as a teen. Lopez, who did his own time as a teen idol when he starred as A.C. Slater on '90s sitcom "Saved By the Bell," will host updates on the search for social media platforms. The worldwide hunt for "Menudo: A New Beginning" will begin later this month with online submissions. Select in-person audition events will also be held, starting with one in San Juan, Puerto Rico. "Like so many people across the globe, I grew up as a huge Menudo fan," Lopez said in a press release. "I am so excited and honored to be part of bringing this iconic Latin boy band back to the world!" The Puerto Rican boy band dominated the preteen market back in the '80s and '90s and are known for introducing new faces as older talent moves on from the group. Although this isn't the first time Menudo has been revived, executives are taking a new approach, with plans for the band to "connect with fans in ways unimaginable just a decade ago," Menudo Productions CEO Paul Tarnopol said in a statement. And according to the press release, "unlike previous group incarnations, the new Menudo members will be sharing in all concert, merchandise, and music revenue." Tarnopol said the management team "is committed to the safety, well-being, and financial security of each-and-every member of Menudo." "This is what we mean by "A New Beginning," he said.
