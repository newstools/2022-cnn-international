London (CNN)Boris Johnson is to resign as the Conservative Party leader on Thursday and is expected to address the nation in the coming hours. "The Prime Minister will make a statement to the country today," a Downing Street spokesman told CNN. Johnson has become engulfed in a series of scandals that forced even his most stalwart supporters to abandon him. More than 50 lawmakers have resigned from the government since Tuesday, furious about the botched handling of the resignation by Johnson's former deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, who was accused of groping two men last week. Johnson initially attempted to ride out the crisis -- despite an unprecedented flight of middle-ranking ministers from the government, a battering at Prime Minister's Questions and a bruising appearance before a committee of senior lawmakers in Parliament. On Wednesday, he still insisted he wasn't going to resign. But Johnson appears finally to have given in on Thursday after some of his most loyal allies told him that the game was up.
