After virtual and scaled-back events due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Comic-Con is back at nearly full force this year in San Diego. Well over 100,000 people are expected to attend the celebration of all things pop culture. Masks will still be required. Organizers called the decision to cancel Comic-Con "heartbreaking" when they did so in April 2020. That was one year after the event commemorated its 50th anniversary.
