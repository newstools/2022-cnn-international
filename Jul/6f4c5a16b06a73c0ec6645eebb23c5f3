Pope Francis was elected in 2013 after Benedict XVI retired. He is the first Latin American pope in history and the first from the Americas. Before he was pope, he was Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires. He chose the name Francis to honor St. Francis of Assisi, who is revered among Catholics for his work with the poor.
