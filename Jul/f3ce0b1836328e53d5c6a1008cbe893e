Protesters broke into the official residence of Sri Lanka's president on Saturday as people were demonstrating over the country's worsening economic crisis. More than 100,000 people also amassed outside, calling for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign, according to police. Rajapaksa was not at the site and had been moved elsewhere, security officials told CNN. The South Asian nation of 22 million is suffering its worst financial crisis in recent history, leaving millions struggling to buy food, medicine and fuel. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets in recent months, calling for the country's leaders to resign over accusations of economic mismanagement.
