(CNN)Novak Djokovic produced another dominant performance to reach the Wimbledon fourth round after beating fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanović 6-0 6-3 6-4 on Friday. After a comprehensive, straight-sets victory against Australia's Thanasi Kokkinakis earlier in the week, Djokovic was once again in a ruthless mood on Centre Court as he swept aside Kecmanović. "Honestly, I think I have been playing better and better as the tournament progresses which is something you always wish for," Djokovic said in his post-match interview on court. "You want to raise the level of tennis up a notch each match, so that's what's happening. "I know I can always do better and I always expect the highest from myself, but so far so good and I look forward to the next round." The top seed raced through the first set in just 24 minutes, as he continues his quest to win a fourth consecutive Wimbledon title. It wasn't until the second game of the second set that Kecmanović, ranked 30th in the world, got on the scoreboard. At one point, that set was evenly poised at 3-3, but Djokovic pulled away with a break of serve at 4-3. In the final set, Djokovic broke twice before Kecmanović hit back with a break of his own -- his first of the match. It proved too little too late, however, and the 20-time grand slam champion had the emphatic win sewn up inside two hours, much to the enjoyment of the crowd. "I don't take your presence for granted, so thank you for coming out and supporting tennis and both players, we appreciate it," he said, addressing Centre Court. Djokovic will face the Netherlands' Tim van Rijthoven in the fourth round. The world No. 104, a wild card in the Wimbledon draw, has shot up the rankings in recent weeks ahead of making his first grand slam appearance. Van Rijthoven defeated Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-4 6-3 6-4 on Friday to take his winning run to eight matches.
