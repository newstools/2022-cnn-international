(CNN)The Kardashian family is growing again. Khloé Kardashian and her ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson will welcome a second child via surrogate, a representative for Kardashian told CNN. The former couple are parents of 4-year-old daughter, True. "We can confirm True will have a sibling who was conceived in November. Khloé is incredibly grateful to the extraordinary surrogate for such a beautiful blessing," the representative said. "We'd like to ask for kindness and privacy so Khloé can focus on her family." In recent years, Kardashian has been open about her desire to grow her family. Her efforts to conceive a second child through IVF and fertility assistance were documented on "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." While Kardashian and Thompson have had a tumultuous romantic relationship that ended in December, they communicate as co-parents. Thompson, a forward for the Chicago Bulls, is also the father of two young sons from other relationships.
