(CNN)In about a month, some of the world's best filmmakers will descend on the "City of Canals" for the 79th Venice International Film Festival. The festival, which kicks off on August 31, typically marks the start of a new film awards season, followed closely by the Telluride Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). On Tuesday, the festival released its annual lineup of films. Most notable of the lineup is the opening night film, Noah Baumbach's "White Noise," an adaptation of the Don DeLillo novel and the first time a Netflix movie has opened the festival. The film stars indie favorites Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig, as well as acting heavyweight Don Cheadle. Other standouts are "Blonde," a drama about Marilyn Monroe, and Olivia Wilde's "Don't Worry Darling." Here's a list of all the films to look forward to this year.
