President Joe Biden arrived in Israel on Wednesday for the start of a four-day visit to the Middle East. It is his first trip to the region since being elected president. On Thursday, Biden met with Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and Israeli President Isaac Herzog. Herzog awarded Biden with the Presidential Medal of Honor for his support of Israel throughout his career. Biden said it was "among the greatest honors of my career." Biden will meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank on Friday. On Saturday he will be in Saudi Arabia to attend a summit of Gulf nations and meet with Saudi King Salman and his advisers, including Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. Biden's trip to Saudi Arabia has drawn criticism given that US intelligence has deemed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for ordering the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Biden has defended his trip by saying it is critical to the security of the United States.
