(CNN)Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Kevin Hart are always keeping us laughing. Johnson posted a video to his Instagram of the two stars doing a "tortilla challenge," a TikTok trend that involves two individuals slapping each other across the face with a tortilla while trying not to spit out a mouthful of water. "You can tell @KevinHart4Real has been waiting for the day he can finally slap the sh*t out of me with no consequences," The Rock wrote. Ultimately, Johnson won the challenge but not before Hart was able to slap him twice with a giant tortilla. You can watch the action here. (They use some colorful language.) The two friends are busy promoting their upcoming animated film "DC League of Super-Pets," which hits theaters on Friday.
