Patagonia is a land of extremes, home to spectacular and reclusive wildlife that has what it takes to survive in one of the world's last great wildernesses. The new Original Series "Patagonia: Life on the Edge of World," which premieres at 9 p.m. ET on July 10, captures the compelling stories of the animals and plants that live on the pristine southern tip of South America. Rare cold-water corals in the fjord lands, pocket-size predators in the region's magical ancient forests, dancing birds on the volcanic plateaus of the wild highlands and resourceful orca on the desert coast -- these are a few of the elusive creatures featured in the nature series, some of which haven't been filmed before.
