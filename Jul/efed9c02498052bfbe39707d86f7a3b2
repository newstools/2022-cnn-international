(CNN)Ren McCormack's still got it. Actor Kevin Bacon served up a dose of nostalgia on his TikTok last week when he performed a viral "Footloose"-themed challenge with his wife Kyra Sedgwick. In the video, set to Kenny Loggins' iconic title track, Bacon, 63, walks toward Sedgwick (with plenty of swaying and finger-snapping swagger) and then lifts up his dance partner before releasing her, holding only one leg and her wrist. The video has amassed more than 13.8 million views so far. Bacon, who starred in the 1984 film as rebel teen Ren McCormack, wrote on his post, "I don't remember this being part of the original #Footloose #dance choreography, but figured we give it a spin." He added in the comments: "And yes, this was just as hard as it looks." Although the couple's spectacular performance seemed pretty smooth, the actor later revealed on Instagram that their routine was not as seamless as it looked. In a picture he posted, Sedgwick is seen with an ice pack on her wrist. "The aftermath of nailing a TikTok dance #Footloose," the actor wrote. No one said cutting loose comes without a price.
