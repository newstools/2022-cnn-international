One death has been confirmed in the latest spell of monsoon rains, adding to the 29 reported since they began last month. The streets of affluent areas such as the Defence Housing Authority complex and Clifton were flooded, with water gushing into houses. Karachi's main streets, which house financial institutions and bank headquarters including Pakistan's central bank, were flooded and rescue services were using boats to reach stranded people. The Pakistan Navy was also taking part in the relief and rescue operations. "Deeply saddened by the tragic losses due to torrential rains in Karachi," Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Twitter. He offered all possible support for the Karachi administration. The highway linking Quetta city to Karachi was also closed for traffic as sections of it were swept away by flash floods.
