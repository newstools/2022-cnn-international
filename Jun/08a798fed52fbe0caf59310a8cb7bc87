The rainbow flag, a symbol of the LGBTQ community, has been flown proudly in recent weeks as people across the United States take part in Pride Month celebrations. But it hasn't always been as ubiquitous as it is today. The flag was designed in 1978 by Gilbert Baker, a gay artist and activist who had been commissioned to design a symbol by his friend Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in California. Back then the flag had eight colors, not the six it has now. Each color carries a different meaning. For example, red represents life, while orange represents healing. The first rainbow flag flew in San Francisco for its Gay Pride Day on June 25, 1978. It was hand-sewn and measured 30 by 60 feet. "We needed something to express our joy, our beauty, our power. And the rainbow did that," Baker said. In 2018, the Progress Pride flag was created by Daniel Quasar, a non-binary artist and designer. Based on the iconic rainbow flag from 1978, the redesign celebrates the diversity of the LGBTQ community and calls for a more inclusive society. Baker, who designed the original flag, died in 2017 at the age of 65, but as these photos show, his legacy lives on.
