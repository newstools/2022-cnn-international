Afghanistan was rocked by its deadliest earthquake in decades on Wednesday when a magnitude 5.9 quake struck the country's east, killing more than 1,000 people and wounding many more. The earthquake hit in the early hours of the morning near the city of Khost by the Pakistan border and the death toll is expected to rise as many of the homes in the area were constructed out of materials vulnerable to damage. The humanitarian disaster comes at a difficult time for the Taliban-ruled country, currently in the throes of hunger and economic crises. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
