McGinley, Judy Reyes, and Neil Flynn on a panel a panel at the ATX TV Festival in Austin, Texas. "We're all so grateful any of you still care, it gives us an excuse to hang out together," Lawrence reportedly said. "We are happy to spend time with each other in any way." "I think we all want a reboot and want to work together again but it couldn't be a full season," Faison, who played surgeon Christopher Turk on the series, said. "Maybe like a movie or something we could shoot in a few months," he continued. "With everything Bill is doing now, he's never going to be free again. If he finds the time, we'll do it." Lawrence is the co-creator of another hit show, "Ted Lasso." "We're gonna do it because people still care about it and we enjoy spending time with each other," Lawrence said.
