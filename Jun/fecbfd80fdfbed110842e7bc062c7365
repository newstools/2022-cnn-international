(CNN)Martha Stewart had to miss out on an event she was looking forward to after testing positive for Covid-19.

According to Mario Badescu Skin Care's verified Instagram account, "When Mario Badescu was just getting started, he met a young and ambitious woman named Martha Stewart.

Now 80, Stewart remains close to the brand. "I'm heartbroken to be missing the celebration of over 50 years of amazing skincare and the launch of 'The Martha Facial' at their NYC flagship - which is a special offer of the facial I've been receiving there for more than forty years!, she wrote on Instagram. "Cheers to what I'm sure will be a fabulous event."
