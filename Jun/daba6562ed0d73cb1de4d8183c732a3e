(CNN)An Ohio woman was gored by a bison after she got within 10 feet of the animal in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, officials said. The 25-year-old woman, whose name has not been released, suffered puncture wound and other injuries Monday after she approached a bison near a boardwalk at Black Sand Basin, park officials said in a news release. "Consequently, the bison gored the woman and tossed her 10 feet into the air," the news release said.  Park emergency medical providers responded and the woman was taken to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center by ambulance, officials said. "This is the first reported incident in 2022 of a visitor threatening a bison (getting too close to the animal) and the bison responding to the threat by goring the individual," officials said in the news release. "Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans." Two other people were also within 25 feet of the same bison, according to the news release. Park officials are reminding visitors to keep back more than 25 yards from large animals such as bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose and coyotes -- and at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves. The incident is under investigation.
