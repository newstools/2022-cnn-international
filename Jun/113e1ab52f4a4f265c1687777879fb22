(CNN)Britney Spears' ex-husband was arrested and charged with trespassing and battery after crashing her wedding Thursday at her California home, police said. The pop star was set to marry Sam Asghari at her hillside mansion in Thousand Oaks when Ventura County Sheriff's deputies were called to the residence in response to a trespassing report, according to police. The trespassing suspect was identified as Jason Alexander, according to Sgt. Cyrus Zadeh with the county sheriff's office. Alexander was confronted by security when he entered the singer's property, and an altercation ensued between him and two security officers, Zadeh told CNN. Both security guards were battered in the physical struggle.  Alexander was arrested and charged with misdemeanor trespassing, two misdemeanor counts of battery, and a misdemeanor vandalism charge, Zadeh said. Authorities also learned that Alexander was wanted on a felony theft warrant in Napa County. CNN is working to determine whether Alexander has legal representation. Spears was married to Alexander, a childhood friend, for about 55 hours in 2004 before the marriage was annulled. "He was detained, handcuffed and I'm please(d) to report, arrested. Fortunately, Britney is safe," Mathew S. Rosengart, an attorney for Spears, told CNN in a statement. "I'm livid by this security breach and am working closely with law enforcement to ensure he is aggressively prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law." Rosengart did not respond when asked for comment if Spears and Asghari's wedding took place following the incident. Spears has been engaged to Asghari, a personal trainer turned actor, since last September. The couple met in 2016 when Asghari co-starred with Spears in the video to her single, "Slumber Party." The pop star icon has been previously married to Alexander and dancer Kevin Federline, with whom she shares two sons.  CNN's Chloe Melas contributed to this report.
