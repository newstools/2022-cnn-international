(CNN)Lizzo announced she has edited one of her songs after complaints from some in the disabled community. "It's been brought to my attention that there is a harmful word in my new song "GRRRLS," the singer wrote in a statement posted on her verified Instagram account on Monday. "Let me make one thing clear: I never want to promote derogatory language," she continued. "As a fat black woman in America, I've had many hateful words used against me so I understand the power words can have (whether intentionally or in my case unintentionally). I'm proud to say there's a new version of GRRRLS with a lyric change." The song contained the word "spaz," which drew complaints that it is a slur against those who are disabled. "Hey @lizzo my disability Cerebral Palsy is literally classified as Spastic Diplegia (where spasticity refers to unending painful tightness in my legs) your new song makes me pretty angry + sad," one person tweeted. "'Spaz' doesn't mean freaked out or crazy. It's an ableist slur. It's 2022. Do better." That same Twitter user later thanked Lizzo after the Grammy winner announced she was changing the lyric, calling Lizzo "a real true ally." Lizzo also seemed appreciate of the heads up. "This is the result of me listening and taking action," she ended her statement. "As an influential artist I'm dedicated to being part of the change I've been waiting to see in the world."
