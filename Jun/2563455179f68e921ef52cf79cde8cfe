Queen Elizabeth II is celebrating 70 years on the throne, a milestone that has never been reached by any other British monarch. To mark this unprecedented anniversary, there are Platinum Jubilee events taking place across the country. A four-day holiday weekend started Thursday with the Queen's birthday parade, also known as Trooping the Colour. The Queen and members of the royal family made their customary balcony appearance at Buckingham Palace before the event ended with a six-minute flypast by the Royal Air Force. This is the Queen's first jubilee without her husband, Prince Philip, who died last year. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
