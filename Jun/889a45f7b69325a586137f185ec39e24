(CNN)Jennifer Hudson made history Sunday night. The "Respect" star joined the elite EGOT club. An EGOT is an artist who has won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and a Tony Award in their career. Hudson already had an Emmy, Grammy and Oscar and on Sunday she won a Tony, thanks to her role as a co-producer of "A Strange Loop" which won for best musical. Hudson joked to People magazine in 2020 about the plan to join the less than 20 people who hold such a crowning achievement. "I got a dog and named it Oscar, and then I won my Oscar. And then I got a dog and named it Grammy, and then I won my Grammy," she said. "So I think I should get some dogs and name them Emmy and Tony -- and it'll give me good luck, and I'll win [They're] like my good luck charms." Hudson won a 2007 best supporting actress Oscar for her role in "Dreamgirls, two Grammys (best R&B album in 2009 and best musical theater album for the musical "The Color Purple in 2017), and last year she snagged a Daytime Emmy for the animated short "Baba Yag," which she helped voice and co-produced. There are now 17 EGOT winners.
