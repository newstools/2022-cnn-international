It didn't start with this year's nominations like most people might think," he told the publication. "They did let me perform on their show last year, but only after [I gave] assurances that I was not a satanist or devil worshiper, and that my performance would be appropriate for their audience." "At BET, we are passionate advocates for the wonderful diversity that exists within our community," the network said in a statement, according to the report. "We are committed to using all of our platforms to provide visibility and inclusion for all of the many intersections of the Black community." Rapper Jack Harlow, who performed at Sunday's BET Awards, wore a Lil Nas X t-shirt on the red carpet in an apparent show of support.
