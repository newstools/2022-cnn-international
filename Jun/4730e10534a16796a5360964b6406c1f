For the last 10 months, a House select committee has been investigating last year's deadly attack on the US Capitol. On Thursday night, we began to learn what it has uncovered. In the committee's first prime-time public hearing, it presented previously unseen material related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection, when supporters of former President Donald Trump breached the Capitol, attacking officers and destroying parts of the building. Thursday's hearing included video from Trump's inner circle, including clips of former Attorney General Bill Barr and former White House adviser Ivanka Trump. It also included video of the attack that had not yet been released. The hearing was a broad overview of the panel's findings, setting the stage for subsequent hearings that will continue next week. While the committee cannot bring legal charges against Trump, its central mission has been to uncover the full scope of Trump's unprecedented attempt to stop the transfer of power.
