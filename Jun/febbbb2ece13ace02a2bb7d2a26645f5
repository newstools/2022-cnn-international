Broadway's best were recognized Sunday night at New York's Radio City Music Hall. The Tony Awards show was hosted by Broadway veteran Ariana DeBose, who recently starred in the film "West Side Story" and won an Oscar for best supporting actress. "A Strange Loop" took home awards for best musical and best book of a musical. The show, which follows an aspiring playwright and his dizzying, personified thoughts, won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for drama. The pop-musical "MJ," which takes place during a Michael Jackson tour, won four awards including best performance by an actor in a leading role. "The Lehman Trilogy" won five awards including best play. The last year marked a triumphant, if spotty, return for Broadway, which was shuttered for over a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Shows began to reopen in September 2021, though subsequent outbreaks forced several shows to cancel performances.
