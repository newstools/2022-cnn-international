(CNN)Britney Spears' ex-husband Jason Alexander appeared in court this week to face charges for breaking into the singer's home on her wedding day. Alexander pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of misdemeanor trespassing, two misdemeanor counts of battery and a misdemeanor vandalism charge. At the time of his arrest last week, authorities also learned that Alexander was wanted on a felony theft warrant in Napa County. CNN reached out to an attorney for Alexander for comment. Spears' attorney Mathew Rosengart told CNN that the Grammy winner was also granted a restraining order against Alexander, which will remain in effect for three years. Rosengart said he is working closely with law enforcement "to ensure that Alexander is vigorously prosecuted and expressed his thanks to the Ventura County Sheriff and District Attorney. "This should be a lesson to anyone who engages in similar conduct," Rosengart added. Alexander is currently in jail with his bail set at $100,000. Alexander allegedly hopped a wall at Spears' hillside mansion in Thousand Oaks, California and began livestreaming as he walked through Spears' property, just hours before she was set to marry Sam Asghari. "My name's Jason Alexander. Britney invited me here. Britney Spears invited me here. She's my first wife, my only wife. I'm her first husband," he said on the livestream. Ventura County Sheriff's deputies were called to the residence in response to a trespassing report, according to police. Spears was briefly married to Alexander, a childhood friend, for about two days in 2004 before their marriage was annulled.
