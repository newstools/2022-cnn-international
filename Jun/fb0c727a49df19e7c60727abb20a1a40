The House select committee investigating last year's attack on the US Capitol held its first prime-time hearing on Thursday night. The hearing included previously unseen material related to the January 6, 2021, insurrection, when supporters of former President Donald Trump breached the Capitol, attacking officers and destroying parts of the building. Thursday's presentation included video of the attack that had not yet been released. It also had recorded testimony from Trump's inner circle, including former Attorney General Bill Barr and former White House adviser Ivanka Trump. The hearing was a broad overview of the panel's findings, setting the stage for subsequent hearings that will continue next week. While the committee cannot bring legal charges against Trump, its central mission has been to uncover the full scope of Trump's unprecedented attempt to stop the transfer of power. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
