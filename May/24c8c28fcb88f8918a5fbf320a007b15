(CNN)After struggling in the first round, Tiger Woods rebounded in the second round of the PGA Championship to make the cut. Woods shot a 1-under-par 69 on Friday and finished at 3-over through the first 36 holes. The cut line was 4-over. Woods had shot a 4-over 74 in the first round Thursday. The 46-year-old Woods is now 12 shots behind current clubhouse leader Will Zalatoris, who stands at 9-under heading into Saturday's round three. During Thursday's first round, Woods appeared to grimace in some discomfort after teeing off on the eighth hole -- his second-to-last hole of his opening round. Immediately after finishing, Woods was asked by an ESPN correspondent how his surgically repaired right leg felt, Woods said, "it has felt better before" while smiling.  When asked by ESPN how Woods was able to ignore what was going on physically with him after Friday's round, he responded, "There's a mission. The mission is to go ahead and win this thing somehow and I know sometimes it doesn't exactly feel well but hey, that's what it is. That's life, that's sports. We push it, sometimes it breaks but that's OK, you get back out there and that's why I got a great PT staff. I'm really good at breaking things and really good at fixing things, so it's a great relationship." The third round of the PGA Championship begins on Saturday from the Southern Hills Country Club, in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
