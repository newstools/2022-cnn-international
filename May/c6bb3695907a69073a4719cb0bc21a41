Country music legend Naomi Judd -- one half of the duo The Judds -- has died, her daughter Ashley Judd announced Saturday. She was 76. The Judds are best known for hits like "Mama He's Crazy" and "Love Can Build a Bridge." The duo picked up a total of five Grammys, nine CMA awards and seven ACM awards. The Country Music Hall of Fame described The Judds' music as having "distinctive harmonies," with "powerful" lead vocals and acoustic accompaniments with elements of "traditional folk, blues and family harmony." The Judds' final performance was at the 2022 CMT Music Awards and Judd's death came a day before she was to be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.
