(CNN)Anthony Anderson is a proud graduate of Howard University. The "Black-ish" actor, who is 51, showed off his new diploma in an Instagram post, thanking his professors and calling it "30 years in the making." "To quote Biggie, 'IT WAS ALL A DREAM!'" Anderson wrote. "Words can't begin to describe the emotional roller coaster [sic] I'm on right now. It's literally been 30 years in the making. This spring I was finally able to complete the work to graduate from Howard University with a BFA degree from the Chadwick A Boseman College of Fine Arts! Yesterday was a full circle moment," he continued. "It's never too late! Things happen when they're supposed to happen!" He also thanked his son for encouraging him to go back to school. "It takes a village. Thank you to my son @hotboynato for inspiring me to return to school to finish my degree after he was accepted into Howard University. This is just the beginning! HU," he wrote. Anderson also shared some pictures from the ceremony, including one with fellow Howard grad, Taraji P. Henson, who delivered the commencement address. In 2018 Anderson said he initially dropped out after his junior year because he ran out of money. He was able to finish online and from home.
