(CNN)Kim Kardashian has gone beyond just sharing her recipe for vegan tacos. The mogul is using her star power to promote Beyond Meat in a campaign that finds her with a a fancy new title - Chief Taste Consultant. "I believe so much in the mission of Beyond Meat that I've stepped in to help with my greatest asset," Kardashian says in a video posted on her verified Instagram account. "My taste." The video features a blonde Kardashian, dressed all in black and flanked by two men wearing chef's gear, tasting several plant-based meat products. "I'm so inspired by @beyondmeat's mission and excited to share their delicious plant-based products with all of you as their Chief Taste Consultant," the caption of the video reads. Kardashian first offered up her recipe for plant-based tacos last year for her sister Kourtney Kardashian's Poosh lifestyle site and said she started eating more plant based after watching a documentary about it.
