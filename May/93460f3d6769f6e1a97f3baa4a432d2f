(CNN)Bruce Willis is staying fit while he deals with his aphasia diagnosis. His wife,  Emma Heming Willis, recently posted a video on the Instastory portion of her verified Instagram account that showed the actor shooting hoops with a few other men. "I see you BeeDub," she wrote on the video. It was announced in March that Willis was stepping back from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, a condition that impacts a person's cognitive abilities. In an interview with The Bump published this month, Heming Willis said she struggles "with making the time for self-care every day" while also caring for her family, which includes their two young daughters, Evelyn and Mabel. "That amount of care for everyone else within my household had taken a toll on my mental health and overall health, and it served no one in my family," she said. "Someone told me not long ago that when you over-care for someone, you end up under-caring for yourself. That stopped me in my tracks and really resonated with me."
