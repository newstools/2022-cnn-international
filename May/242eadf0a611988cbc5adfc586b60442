The United States' withdrawal from Afghanistan and the subsequent fall of Kabul have changed the course of history for the country. Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent and staff photographer Marcus Yam was there to document those desperate to escape and others that faced the wrath of the Taliban. He won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography last week. The judges said these "raw and urgent" images captured the human cost of the "historic change in the country." These images are powerful and distressing, and in some cases, graphic.
