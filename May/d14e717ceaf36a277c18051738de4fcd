A mass shooting at a Texas elementary school left 19 students and two teachers dead on Tuesday, throwing the nation into mourning. The shooting took place at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, which is about 90 miles west of San Antonio. The gunman, who officials have identified as Salvador Ramos, was on the school premises for up to an hour before law enforcement forcibly entered a classroom and killed him, officials said Wednesday. Ramos also shot his grandmother before going to the school. Tuesday's massacre is the second-deadliest school shooting since 2012, when 26 children and adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
