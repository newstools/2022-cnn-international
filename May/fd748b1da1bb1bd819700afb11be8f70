For Mother's Day this year, we asked mothers who are photographers to share their personal stories. "Motherhood to me means community, tradition, leadership and love," Nigerian photographer Adenike Sogbesan said. "It is confidently training my daughter to have a voice in the society we have today. To follow the steps she wants to take in life without being afraid. To dream and accomplish as a woman without worrying about her background, color or if the world will love her." Produced in partnership with Visura, a global platform for discovering visual storytellers, this selection of photos reflects the unconditional love and resilience of mothers around the world.
