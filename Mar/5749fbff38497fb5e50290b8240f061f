Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dominated the headlines this past week, and fighting continues to take place throughout the country. So far, the Ukrainian resistance has been able to hold Kyiv and many other key cities. But Russian forces have shown no signs of letting up, and there have already been hundreds of civilian casualties, according to the United Nations. Meanwhile, more than a million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries. The United States, the European Union and other Western allies have begun rolling out sanctions in response to Russia's actions. Many people around the world have also been rallying in support of Ukraine. US President Joe Biden used his first State of the Union address to blast Russian President Vladimir Putin. "Putin's latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked," Biden said Wednesday. "He rejected repeated, repeated, efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn't respond. He thought he could divide us at home, in this chamber and in this nation. Putin was wrong. We were ready."
