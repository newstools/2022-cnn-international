(CNN)Nelly Korda, the world No. 2 in women's golf, is receiving treatment for a blood clot. Korda announced the news on her Instagram account, saying that she went to the emergency room after feeling some swelling in her arm. "On Friday I was in Ponte Vedra Beach, FL for a photoshoot and a commercial appearance," she said. "After a typical morning workout, my arm started to feel like it was swelling. At the advice of my doctor, I went to the Emergency Room as a precaution. I was diagnosed with a blood clot." "I am currently at home getting treatment to eliminate further risks. I will communicate my status as and when there is more information. In the meantime, I want to thank everyone for their support and ask for privacy for all our family during this time. I hope to be back soon! Thank you." The 23-year-old American has been fighting for the world No. 1 spot with Ko Jin-young, and they are scheduled to meet for the first time this season at the Chevron Championship -- formerly the ANA Inspiration -- in Rancho Mirage, California. That tournament begins in two weeks, on March 31. Korda gave no indication regarding her scheduled return. The setback continues her difficult start to the season following a 20th place finish at the Gainbridge LPGA at Boca Rico tournament and the loss of her world No. 1 ranking which she had held for 29 consecutive weeks. Korda elected to skip the LPGA's Asian swing and has not played competitively since early February when she finished in a share of 15th place at the LPGA Drive on Championship at Crown Colony.
