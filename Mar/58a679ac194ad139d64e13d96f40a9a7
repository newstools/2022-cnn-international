We are now two weeks into the war in Ukraine, and Russia continues its assault on major cities, including the capital of Kyiv. On Wednesday, a maternity and children's hospital was bombed in Mariupol. The attack came despite Russia agreeing to a 12-hour pause in hostilities to allow refugees to evacuate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the hospital attack an "atrocity," and the United Nations said it would follow up urgently on the "shocking reports." Mariupol, on Ukraine's southeast coast, has been under siege for days and has been "isolated" by Russian forces, a senior US defense official said Tuesday. Since the invasion began, more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations' refugee agency.
