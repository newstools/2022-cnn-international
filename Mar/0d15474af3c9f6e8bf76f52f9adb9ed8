(CNN)UFC star Conor McGregor was arrested by Irish police on Tuesday evening and charged with alleged dangerous driving. Videos reposted by McGregor onto his Twitter feed show the fighter driving on a motorway, before police turn on their sirens and begin to pull him over. "Gardaí arrested a man aged in his 30s in relation to an incident of dangerous driving in the Palmerstown area, Tuesday 22nd March 2022," police said in a statement to CNN. "The man was taken to Lucan Garda Station where he was later charged. He has been released pending an appearance before Blanchardstown District Court at a later date." In a statement sent to CNN, Karen Kessler, spokesperson for McGregor, said: "Mr McGregor was driving to the gym when he was stopped by Gardai for alleged road traffic violations. He passed the drug and alcohol tests taken at the station." The 33-year-old hasn't fought since breaking his leg in a fight with Dustin Poirier last July, but is expected to return to the octagon later this year after posting a number of training videos to his social media accounts. Back in October, an Italian DJ claimed he suffered a number of injuries following an alleged altercation with McGregor. Francesco Facchinetti said McGregor launched an unprovoked attack at the St. Regis Hotel in Rome, leaving him with injuries to his face and neck. Police confirmed to CNN that Facchinetti and his attorney formally pressed charges. CNN's calls to police for an update on the case have not been returned. In August 2019, McGregor admitted he was "in the wrong" following an altercation in a pub in Dublin in April of the same year and pleaded guilty.
