Confirmation hearings were held this week for Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman ever to be nominated for the US Supreme Court. Jackson, 51, is President Joe Biden's pick to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. Jackson, who currently sits on DC's federal appellate court, once worked for Breyer. Throughout the hearings this week, Jackson defended her experience and credentials as she faced criticisms from Republican senators on her judicial philosophy and legal record. No Democratic senators have signaled they will oppose Jackson, and a vote will be held on April 4. "If I am confirmed, I commit to you that I will work productively to support and defend the Constitution and the grand experiment of American democracy that has endured over these past 246 years," Jackson said in her opening statement. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
