Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke to US lawmakers on Wednesday, March 16, appealing for more help as his country fights back against Russia's invasion. Zelensky invoked major tragedies in US history as he spoke to Congress via a virtual address. He expressed gratitude to US President Joe Biden while arguing that more assistance is desperately needed. "Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of December 7, 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you," Zelensky said. "Just remember it, remember, September the 11th, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn US cities into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it and you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same, every day, right now at this moment." The historic speech sparked renewed debate over what more the US can do to aid Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia three weeks ago. Biden later pledged ongoing US aid and announced an additional $800 million in security assistance as he condemned Russia's attacks. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
