Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as US secretary of state, has died of cancer at the age of 84. Albright was a central figure in President Bill Clinton's administration, first serving as US ambassador to the United Nations before becoming the nation's top diplomat in his second term. While in office, she championed NATO expansion and pushed for the alliance to intervene in the Balkans to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing. Throughout her retirement, Albright continued working for democracy around the world and speaking about US policy. Asked by USA Today in August 2020 how she defined courage, Albright replied that it is "when you stand up for what you believe in when it's not always easy and you get criticized for it."
