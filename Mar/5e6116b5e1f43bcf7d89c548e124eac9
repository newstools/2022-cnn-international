(Reuters)Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) said Tuesday that the cybersecurity breach it has been investigating for almost a week has resulted in the theft of company data. "We are aware that the threat actor took employee credentials and some NVIDIA proprietary information from our systems and has begun leaking it online," a company spokesperson told CNN in a statement. There is no indication that the attack was an instance of ransomware or that it is connected to the war in Ukraine, the spokesperson added. The company reiterated that it does not expect any disruptions to business operations stemming from the breach, which was first detected Feb. 23. At a market cap of about $600 billion, Nvidia is the most valuable chipmaker in the United States. It is known for its graphics processing units (GPU) that enhance videogaming experiences and advanced computer simulations. Reuters contributed to this report.
