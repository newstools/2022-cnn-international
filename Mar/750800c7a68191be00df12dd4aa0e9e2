The British Academy Film Awards, aka the BAFTAs, were handed out in London on Sunday. The BAFTAs are traditionally considered to be the film industry's last big stop before the Academy Awards. This year, the show was held on the same day as the delayed Critics' Choice Awards. Actress and comedian Rebel Wilson hosted the BAFTA ceremony from the Royal Albert Hall. The sci-fi film "Dune" won the most awards (five) and received the most nominations (11). The Western drama "The Power of the Dog" won the BAFTA for best film, and its director, Jane Campion, won best director.
