(CNN)Maksim Chmerkovskiy shared an emotional reunion with his wife at the Los Angeles airport on Wednesday. In a video tweeted by "Entertainment Tonight," the "Dancing With the Stars" alum is shown being embraced by his wife Peta Murgatroyd after he landed back in the US from Ukraine. "I just don't want to resent peace somewhere else because of what I just saw, that's the reality," he told "Entertainment Tonight." "I don't know really what to say right this second." Chmerkovskiy had been documenting what he witnessed in Ukraine after Russian forces invaded last week. According to his representative, Chmerkovskiy, who immigrated to the United States from Ukraine with his family in the 1990s, had been in Ukraine working on the reality competition series "World of Dance UA." He left for Poland via train and on Wednesday shared a video from Warsaw, as he awaited a flight home to California. Chmerkovskiy spoke of destruction in Ukraine and civilian deaths, while urging his followers to protest the war. "Please continue yelling," he said. "The whole world is already against [the invasion]."
