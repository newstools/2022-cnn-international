(CNN)"Futurama" is bringing back cast holdout John DiMaggio. With the recent announcement that Matt Groening and David X. Cohen were bringing back the beloved animated series to Hulu in 2023, it was initially moving forward without DiMaggio, who plays foul-mouthed robot Bender, while he negotiated his contract. But DiMaggio took to Twitter on Tuesday with news of his return, writing, "I'M BACK, BABY!" During his contract negotiations, DiMaggio had explained to fans on twitter, "Bender is part of my soul and nothing about this is supposed to be disrespectful to the fans or my Futurama family." With an update he added, "It's about self-respect. And honestly, being tired of an industry that's become far too corporate and takes advantage of artists' time and talent." Futurama tells the story of 25-year-old pizza delivery boy Philip Fry, played by Billy West, who accidentally freezes himself in 1999 and wakes up 1,000 years later. The show keeps getting new life in renewals. It originally aired on Fox before being canceled, then it was picked up by Comedy Central and then canceled. It was announced three weeks ago the latest version of the show would be airing on Hulu.
