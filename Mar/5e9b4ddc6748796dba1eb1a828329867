(CNN)Rachel Zegler has been asked to present at this year's 94th Academy Awards, according to The Hollywood Reporter. CNN has reached out to Zegler and the Academy to see if she plans to take them up on the offer. Zegler, who starred as Maria Vasquez in Oscar-nominated musical drama "West Side Story," recently commented on Instagram that she was not invited to this year's awards show. Zegler, who won a Golden Globe, for her role in the Steven Spielberg directed film, was responding to a fan who asked her on Instagram what she was going to be wearing to the show. "I'm not invited so sweatpants and my boyfriend's flannel," Zegler wrote. Adding, "Idk y'all i have tried it all but it doesn't seem to be happening :') I will root for west side story from my couch and be proud of the work we so tirelessly did 3 years ago. I hope some last minute miracle occurs and I can celebrate our film in person but hey, that's how it goes sometimes, I guess. Thanks for all the shock and outrage - I'm disappointed too. But That's okay. So proud of our movie." As CNN has previously reported, nominees (Zegler is not individually nominated) receive tickets, as do presenters, with additional tickets given to studios to distribute as they see fit. The Oscars will be held on Sunday at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood and televised live on ABC.
