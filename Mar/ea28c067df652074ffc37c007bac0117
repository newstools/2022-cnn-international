The Critics' Choice Awards were presented Sunday night in Los Angeles and London, honoring the best performances in film and television. The show was hosted by Nicole Byer and Taye Diggs. It was initially supposed to be held in January, but it was moved back because of Covid-19 concerns. HBO's "Succession" had the most nominations this year for a television show (eight), and it won the award for best drama series. "The Power of the Dog" won best picture and best director (Jane Campion).
