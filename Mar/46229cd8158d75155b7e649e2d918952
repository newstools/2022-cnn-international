(CNN)Before he became president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky was a successful actor and comedian. Now Netflix is again streaming the TV series that helped make him a star -- and served as a springboard for his presidential campaign. "Servant of the People" is a political satire featuring Zelensky as a high school teacher who becomes the Ukrainian president after a speech he makes about corruption in the country's government goes viral.  The series debuted in 2015. Some have credited the role with helping catapult Zelensky to Ukraine's real-life presidency in 2019. "You asked and it's back!" Netflix said in a tweet Wednesday, announcing the series' return. Zelensky is currently dominating the world stage with his impassioned pleas for help following Russia's invasion of his country.
