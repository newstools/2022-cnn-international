(CNN)Singer Adele has announced the postponement of her Las Vegas residency, one day before it was set to kick off, saying Covid has rendered it impossible to move forward. In a tearful video posted to Instagram, an apologetic Adele said her team "tried absolutely everything we can to put it together in time and for it to be good enough for you, but we've been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and Covid." "I'm so sorry but my show ain't ready," she said. "Half my crew, half my team is down with Covid. They still are, and it's been impossible to finish the show. And I can't give you what I have right now, and I'm gutted." Adele's series of shows at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace was set to begin Friday and go through April 16. Tickets were made available in December, with record-breaking sales. "And I'm sorry it's so last minute. We've been awake for over 30 hours now trying to figure it out, and we've run out of time," she said. "And I'm so upset, and I'm really embarrassed and I'm so sorry to everyone who traveled, again." The "Hello" singer said dates would be rescheduled. "It's been impossible. We've been up against so much, and it just ain't ready," she said. "I'm really sorry."
