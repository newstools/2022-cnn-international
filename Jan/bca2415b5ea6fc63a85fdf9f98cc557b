(CNN)Emma Watson is taking a Emma Roberts photo snafu in stride. During the HBO Max special "Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts," a photo of a young Roberts was mistakenly identified as Watson. Watson shared the photo of Roberts on Instagram Wednesday and had a bit of fun with the confusion. "I was NOT this cute, @emmaroberts," Watson wrote in the caption, along with a laughing emoji and #emmasistersforever. Viewers alerted HBO Max, which is owned by CNN's parent company, about the incorrect identification and an updated version of the special has been released.
