A severe winter storm left some motorists stranded for more than 24 hours this week as they traveled on Interstate 95 in eastern Virginia. The storm dumped more than a foot of snow in the area between Richmond and Washington, DC, but a big part of the problem was that disabled trucks were blocking the way, transportation officials said. Many people, lacking food and water, abandoned their vehicles as they waited for traffic to start moving again. Others stayed inside, turning their engines on occasionally for heat and then turning them off to conserve fuel. The 50-mile stretch of I-95 was eventually reopened on Tuesday night. Here are some of the other stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
