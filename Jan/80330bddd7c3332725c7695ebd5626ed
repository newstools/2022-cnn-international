"It definitely affects me because I'm a human being," he said. Cannon made headlines last year after he welcomed four children within 14 months. He is a father of seven children with four mothers, including 10-year-old twins he shares with his ex-wife, superstar Mariah Carey.

I want a big family too," he said. "The Lord has blessed me with what I asked, but ask and you shall receive. "
