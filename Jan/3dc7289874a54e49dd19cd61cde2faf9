Tensions between Ukraine and Russia are at their highest in years, with a Russian troop buildup near the border spurring fears Moscow could soon launch an invasion. Russia has denied it is planning to attack, arguing that NATO support for Ukraine — including increased weapons supplies and military training — constitutes a growing threat on its western flank.
