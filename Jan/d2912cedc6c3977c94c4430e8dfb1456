(CNN)Olivia Jade used her podcast this week to clear up what she says is "a big misconception" about her. The social media influencer's parents went to prison after being involved in a massive college admissions scandal. "I am super aware that I've been given opportunities because of my parents and that I live a very blessed and fortunate and privileged life," she said on her "Conversations with Olivia Jade" podcast episode that dropped Monday. "It's tricky. It's hard to speak on because I know that to the average human, I have it easy. I know that to myself as well." The now 22-year-old's mother, actress Lori Loughlin, was sentenced to two months in federal prison and her father, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, was sentenced to five months in 2020 for their role in the fraud perpetuated to give Olivia Jade and her sister Isabella Rose Giannulli an unfair advantage to get into the University of Southern California. Loughlin was also ordered to serve two years of supervised release with 100 hours of community service and a fine of $150,000. Giannulli received a $250,000 fine, two years of supervised release and 250 hours of community service. Olivia Jade says people don't seem to understand that she's put in work to get to where she's at, from starting her YouTube channel at the age of 14 to being serious about her studies. "I don't even think I've ever said this publicly but in high school, I had straight A's," she said. "I worked really hard at school."
