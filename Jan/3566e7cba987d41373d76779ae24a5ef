Unvaccinated New York-based staff at JPMorgan Chase (JPM) risk losing their jobs, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on Monday in a further indication that banks are getting tougher on employees as they return to work. "If you aren't going to get vaxxed, you won't be able to work in that office. We're not going to pay you not to work in the office," Dimon said. "We want people to get vaccinated." Last week, Citigroup Inc said staff in the United States who had not been vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 14 would be placed on unpaid leave and fired at the end of the month unless granted an exemption. Asked about a possible hybrid work policy in the future by which employees split their time between home and the office, Dimon said: "We don't have to answer this right away."
