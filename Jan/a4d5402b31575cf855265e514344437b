(CNN)They've left Dunder Mifflin behind, but not each other. John Krasinski will direct his former "The Office" costar Steve Carell in his new movie, "If." The movie is a tale about "a child's journey to rediscover their imagination," reports Deadline, and will be directed, written and produced by Krasinski. Krasinski took to social media Tuesday with the news, adding a series of photos of Carell, along with Ryan Reynolds, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Louis Gossett Jr., Fiona Shaw, Alan Kim and Cailey Fleming. "Ah, what if one day I could assemble my dream cast? What ... IF," he wrote. The movie will mark the duo's first professional collaboration since "The Office."
