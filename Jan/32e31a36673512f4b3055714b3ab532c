New York (CNN Busines)Investors clearly didn't want to go into the upcoming three-day weekend holding onto stocks. The Dow fell more than 350 points, led by a steep fall for shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big banks. The Dow was down 1% Friday and is off nearly 1.3% during the past five days. The average of 30 blue chips has now fallen about 1.6% so far this month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq dipped 0.5% and 0.1% respectively, with both set to drop about 1% for the week. The S&P 500 is down nearly 3% in 2022 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has slid more than 5%. A weak retail sales report for December didn't help matters on Wall Street. Consumer spending surprisingly fell during that key holiday shopping month, raising concerns that runaway inflation is finally taking a toll on the economy. But while investors have been shunning big techs like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA) this year, bank stocks were a bright spot for the market — until Friday. Investors were disappointed by JPMorgan Chase's nearly 15% drop in earnings from the fourth quarter of 2020. Shares of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) were down 6%. Fellow financials (and Dow components) Goldman Sachs (GS) — which reports earnings next Tuesday — and American Express (AXP) each fell about 4% too. Citigroup (C) and BlackRock (BLK), which both reported earnings Friday, were also lower. Wells Fargo (WFC) was the bright spot for banks, rallying after posting better-than-expected results. More big banks, including Bank of America (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Truist (TFC), will report their  results in next week's holiday-shortened trading session. Earnings are also on tap from consumer products king Procter & Gamble (PG), airlines United (UAL) and American (AAL) and streaming giant Netflix (NFLX). The stock market is closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.
