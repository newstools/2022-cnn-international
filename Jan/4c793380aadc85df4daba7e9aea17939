Hasbro Inc on Wednesday named Chris Cocks, head of the division housing the "Dungeons and Dragons" game, as the toymaker's chief executive officer, months after longtime CEO Brian Goldner's death. Cocks joined the company from Microsoft in 2016 and was serving as the chief operating officer of its Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming division, which doubled its revenue to surpass $1 billion in 2021. He will take over from interim CEO Rich Stoddart on Feb. 25. Stoddart, who has served as an independent director at Hasbro since 2014, will become the chair of the board. Hasbro (HAS) also said insider Eric Nyman has been appointed as its chief operating officer. Nyman joined Hasbro in 2003 and currently serves as the chief consumer officer and chief operating officer of the company's consumer products division. Hasbro said it expects to name a new president for Wizards of the Coast in the coming weeks.
