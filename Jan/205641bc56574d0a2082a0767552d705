(CNN)In a video looking ahead to 2022, Alec Baldwin reflected on the fatal shooting on the set of his film "Rust." The actor and producer posted the almost 13-minute video on his verified Instagram account on New Year's Day that he captioned, "Another chance to let go of anything that is hurting us. Destroying us." Baldwin began by talking about a young woman who handed him a Splenda packet with a note of encouragement recently while he was out to lunch in a Long Island restaurant. That led him to express his gratitude for the support he received since the shooting incident that resulted in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and the wounding of the movie's director, Joel Souza, "I've had more people who have been kind and thoughtful and generous of spirit than I've had people who are malignant about the death Halyna Hutchins," Baldwin said. I'm not afraid to say that and to couch that in some euphemisms - somebody died very tragically." "And I've gotten so much, I mean so much, goodwill from people," he added. "It's just incredible." The tragedy occurred as Baldwin was handling a prop gun and he said in the video that it "has been, surely, the worst situation I've ever been involved with." "I'm very hopeful that the people in charge with investigating this whole thing get to the truth as soon as possible," he said. "No one wants the truth more than I do." Authorities in Sante Fe, New Mexico, where the shooting occurred are continuing to investigate.
