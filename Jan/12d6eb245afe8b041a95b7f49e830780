(CNN)Christian author Francine Rivers has taken "Redeeming Love" to the big screen. The popular book tells the story of a young orphan who loses her mother and is forced into prostitution during the California Gold Rush . The 1991 novel based on the Old Testament book of Hosea has sold over three million copies since it was first published. Abigail Cowen plays Angel, a prostitute who has suffered a life of abuse. Tom Lewis and Eric Dane also star. The film is directed by DJ Caruso and produced by Roma Downey and Cindy Bond. In an interview with the Christian Post, Rivers said her dream for the film is that people will leave the theaters "understanding how long-suffering, passionate and wonderful God's love is for each of us." "Redeeming Love" debuts in theaters on Friday, Jan. 21.
