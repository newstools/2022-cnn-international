(CNN)Jordan Cashmyer, whose struggle as an unhoused, young, expectant mother was documented on MTV's "16 and Pregnant," has died, according to her family. She was 26. "My oldest beloved daughter, Jordan has passed away, she was only 26 years old," a posting on her father's Facebook page read. "Our hearts are truly broken. No parent should ever have to go through losing a child, EVER." A spokesperson for Maryland's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed Cashmyer's death to CNN.

"We are deeply saddened to learn about the passing of Jordan Cashmyer," the tweet read. "Our hearts go out to her family and friends during this difficult time."
