Ottawa (CNN)Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, has tested positive for Covid-19, he announced Monday, as his nation continues to face a surge in cases due to the Omicron variant, as well as rowdy protests in the capital over pandemic health restrictions. "This morning, I tested positive for COVID-19," tweeted Trudeau, who is fully vaccinated and boosted. "I'm feeling fine -- and I'll continue to work remotely this week while following public health guidelines. Everyone, please get vaccinated and get boosted." Two of Trudeau's three school-age children also have tested positive, the Prime Minister said Monday during an outdoor news conference. He and his family have been isolating for days after announcing a Covid-19 exposure, of which he hasn't given details. Trudeau met in person Wednesday with several members of his Cabinet. The Trudeau family has been relocated to an undisclosed location as a precaution as protests continue in Ottawa by those opposing Covid-19 health restrictions. The events began as a protest by truckers opposed to vaccine requirements and gained followers calling for an end to other Covid-19 mandates. Canada has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with about 4 in every 5 Canadians fully vaccinated, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Trudeau warned Canadians this month to "hunker down" for winter. "The strain on the health care system is tremendous, and as much as we can do, all of us, individually, collectively, to decrease the pressure on the hospital system, our exhausted health care workers on the front line, I think that's really what we need to be focusing on," Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, said. The Prime Minister had not previously reported contracting Covid-19, though his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, tested positive for the virus in March 2020.
