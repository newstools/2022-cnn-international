Sidney Poitier, whose elegant bearing and principled onscreen characters made him Hollywood's first Black movie star, has died at the age of 94. Poitier became the first Black man to win an Academy Award when he took home the best actor Oscar in 1964. Poitier, who won the award for his performance in "Lilies of the Field," was one of the biggest box-office stars of the 1960s. He remained a Hollywood legend in his later years.
