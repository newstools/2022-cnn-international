(CNN)Macaulay Culkin and Brenda Song are engaged. The actor and the "Suite Life" star, who welcomed their 9-month-old son Dakota last April, have been together for four years and are planning on marrying soon, reports People. CNN has reached to representatives of the couple for comment. When their baby was born, Culkin and Song released a statement that said "We're overjoyed." The two met in 2017 on the set of "Changeland," directed by Culkin's friend Seth Green. They have managed to keep their relationship fairly private, with Song revealing on social media the two are homebodies. When they were spotted on a date night in November at an Los Angeles Rams game, she captioned a picture of the date, "Very few things can get us out of the house and away from our son." In August 2020, Song wrote a birthday tribute to Culkin on Instagram, saying: "Happy 40th birthday to this magical being. I could sit here and write endlessly about how wonderful, kind, loving, genuine, loyal, honest, brilliant and hilarious you are, and how grateful I am that I get to share and do this life thing with you. But firstly, that would take me an eternity and secondly, you won't even see this because you don't ever use instagram. Hahaha. My unicorn that I never thought could exist, I am luckiest person in the world because I am loved by you."
