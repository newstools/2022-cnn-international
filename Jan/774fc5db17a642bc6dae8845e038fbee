(CNN)For her heartrending performance in the landmark series "Pose," Michaela Jaé Rodriguez won her first Golden Globe -- and made history. Rodriguez was awarded the Golden Globe for best performance by an actress in a television series-drama for her role as maternal figure Blanca in the third and final season of the FX series. And with her win, she became the first trans actress to win a major acting Golden Globe. "This is the door that is going to Open the door for many more young talented individuals," she wrote on Instagram. "They will see that it is more than possible. They will see that a young Black Latina girl from Newark New Jersey who had a dream, to change the minds others would WITH LOVE. LOVE WINS."  "To my young LGBTQAI babies WE ARE HERE the door is now open now reach the stars!!!!!" she continued. This year's Golden Globes were a muted affair -- NBC declined to broadcast the awards after Los Angeles Times reports revealed a lack of diversity within the secretive Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which holds the awards, and raised ethical questions related to financial benefits. Rodriguez wasn't in attendance at the awards -- no celebrities were. There were no audience members or red carpet events, though the ceremony was still hosted at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Studios didn't officially submit titles for consideration, either, when HFPA members were selecting nominees.  The HFPA instead announced Rodriguez's win on Instagram and Twitter. When it debuted in the summer of 2018, "Pose" had the largest cast of transgender series regulars of any scripted TV program. Also starring Indya Moore as hopeless romantic Angel, Dominique Jackson as headstrong Elektra Abundance and Angelica Ross as the tragic Candy, it was nominated for "outstanding drama series" for its first and third seasons. Rodriguez was also nominated at the 2021 Emmys for her performance as Blanca, becoming the first trans actress to be nominated for a major acting Emmy.
