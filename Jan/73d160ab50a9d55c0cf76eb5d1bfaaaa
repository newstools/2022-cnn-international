New York (CNN)Amazon is shortening its Covid-19 isolation policy to seven days from 10, for a total of up to 40 hours of paid leave, the company announced to employees Friday. The policy change is effective immediately and applies to all its US employees regardless of vaccination status. The decrease in paid leave corresponds to the newly shortened isolation period recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the company said.  "Throughout the past two years, we have consistently based our response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the advice of our own medical experts," Amazon said in a message viewed by CNN Business. The recent surge of cases from the Omicron variant has disrupted business and economic activity throughout different sectors. Another 1,600 flights were canceled Thursday, with airlines citing workers coming down with Covid-19. Macy's is shortening its weekday hours this month. Tuesday's guidance from the CDC said those with Covid-19 can isolate for five days if they have no symptoms. Amazon said all employees must report a positive diagnosis and additional leave options are available for those who are still sick after one week. Earlier this week, Walmart announced it was cutting pandemic-related paid leave to a single week. Walmart and Amazon are the two largest private employers in the US, respectively.
