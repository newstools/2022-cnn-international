(CNN)French star Kylian Mbappé scored a hat-trick as he reached a landmark 200 career goals in Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 Coupe de France win over fourth division Vannes on Monday. The 23-year-old bagged his goals -- taking his career tally to 201 -- in the space of 17 second-half minutes to guide PSG into the last 16 in the absence of four players, including Lionel Messi, who tested positive for Covid-19. The hat-trick is already the 10th of his career and takes his total number of goals for PSG to 150 in just 196 matches since joining from Monaco in 2018. There has been much speculation about Mbappé's future in the French capital, with PSG turning down a $188 million offer for the Frenchman from Spanish giant Real Madrid in August. Mbappé admitted at the time that he wanted to leave PSG, but last week told CNN he is "100%" committed to finishing the season with his current club.

"And to give all the pleasure to the fans because they deserve it. "I was honest [about wanting to leave]. I gave a feeling, I gave what I have in my heart," he said. "I'm happy to stay ... it's my city too. I'm French ... I want to win everything this season."
