Philadelphia (CNN)Thirteen people died in Philadelphia Wednesday morning in a fire that broke out in a three-story home that was converted into apartments, according to a law enforcement official. Investigators have not yet gone inside the home, though the fire is under control, the law enforcement official said. The official requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the investigation. Children died in the fire, Mayor Jim Kenney said at the start of a news conference late Wednesday morning, without providing details. "Losing so many kids is just devastating. ... Keep these babies in your prayers," Kenney said. "This is without a doubt one of the most tragic days in our city's history -- lost of so many people in such a tragic way," the mayor said. Firefighters responded to flames Wednesday morning at a three-story row house in the 800 block of N. 23rd Street in Philadelphia's Fairmount neighborhood, city fire officials tweeted.
