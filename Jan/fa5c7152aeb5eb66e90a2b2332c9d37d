(CNN)Amy Schneider, an engineering manager from Oakland, California, became the first woman and the fourth person on "Jeopardy!" to earn more than $1 million in winnings on Friday's episode. Schneider's $42,200 score in her 28th victory brought her total winnings to $1,019,001, according to the game show. "It feels amazing, it feels strange," Schneider said in a statement. "It's not a sum of money I ever anticipated would be associated with my name."  The only other contestants to win more than $1 million in regular season games are Ken Jennings, whose 74-game streak yielded $2,520,700; James Holzhauer, who earned $2,462,216 over the course of 32 victories; and Matt Amodio, who won $1,518,601 during his 38-game streak last year. Her next game will be broadcast on Monday.
