(CNN)Iliza Shlesinger is a mom. The comedian and her husband Noah Galuten welcomed their first child together, daughter Sierra Mae, on Jan. 13, she revealed on Instagram, alongside some pictures of her in the hospital. "I finally have my very own #babyleg !! I gave birth late at night (because that's when I work) and there was no food available at 1:30am. Noah went to a vending machine and came back with chips and cookies, basically prison commissary food. I think he paid for them in cigarettes," she joked, with a photo of her eating a sandwich the following day. She explained that her "decision to induce came purely from me wanting to have enough time with her and to heal before my February shows." Shlesinger described the birth, saying, "27 hours of labor, 75 minutes of power pushing (they said I had 4 hours and I was like "oh no, this ends NOW. Champions do more.") and at 11:27pm on January 13 out came my healthy, strong and beautiful Sierra Mae." Shlesinger continued: "I'm in awe of this experience: mothers who do this without epidurals, single mothers, mothers without support and just what a woman is capable of physically and mentally." She added that she won't be sharing pictures of her daughter's face, writing, "She is gorgeous but her face is hers to share, not mine. So while I won't show her, I will share us. I will be processing this comedically, artistically and spiritually for the rest of my life and I can't wait."
