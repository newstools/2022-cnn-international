Novak Djokovic was looking to make history at this year's Australian Open. The Serbian tennis star could have won his 21st Grand Slam singles title, putting him all alone at the top of the record books. But history will have to wait after he was deported from Australia on Sunday, January 16. The Australian government decided to cancel his visa on public health and order grounds. Authorities said Djokovic didn't have a valid exemption for Australia's vaccination requirements. Djokovic, who has previously voiced opposition to Covid-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates, was unvaccinated when he arrived in Australia. He tested positive for Covid-19 last month. In a statement, Djokovic said he was "disappointed" with the decision but respected the court's ruling. When he arrived in Serbia, he received a hero's welcome. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
