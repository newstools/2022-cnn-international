(CNN)Facebook has blocked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from posting on its platform for 24 hours, the Georgia Republican said Monday. The congresswoman reacted to the temporary Facebook ban through her Telegram account, writing, "Facebook has joined Twitter in censoring me." A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook's parent company, said Facebook removed one of Greene's posts about Covid-19. "A post violated our policies and we have removed it; but removing her account for this violation is beyond the scope of our policies," the spokesperson said. The decision comes a day after Twitter permanently suspended one of Greene's accounts for repeatedly violating the platform's rules against Covid-19 misinformation. Greene, a right-wing Republican, had most frequently tweeted from the @mtgreenee handle, which had more than 465,000 followers. She still has access to and can tweet from her official congressional account @RepMTG, which has more than 386,000 followers. The congresswoman has a long history of embracing baseless conspiracy theories, and she has been a serial tweeter of false claims -- about the election, the Capitol insurrection and other subjects -- since she won her seat in November 2020. CNN's KFILE previously reported that Greene had removed dozens of Facebook posts from 2018 and 2019 in which she endorsed fringe conspiracy theories and repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians. While the company had not removed those posts, Facebook previously removed posts of Greene's for violating the company's community standards, including ones in which Greene agreed with people who said the 2018 Parkland, Florida, shooting was a "false flag" operation. "False flag" refers to acts that are designed by perpetrators to be made to look like they were carried out by other individuals or groups.
