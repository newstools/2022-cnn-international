(CNN)The Masters announced Saturday it is increasing its total prize money, which will make it the highest payout at a major. In a news release, the tournament stated the total prize money for professionals for this year's event will be $15 million, an increase from last year's purse of $11.5 million, from which Hideki Matsuyama won $2.07 million for finishing first. This year's winner will go home with a whopping $2.7 million Sunday night, as well as the famous green jacket. The top three finishers will each receive more than a million dollars, with second place receiving $1.62 million and third getting $1.02 million. The Masters is now the highest paying major, ahead of the $12.5 million purse at last year's US Open. It's not the highest paying golf tournament in the world, though, as it still sits behind the Players Championship, which has a $20 million prize purse.
