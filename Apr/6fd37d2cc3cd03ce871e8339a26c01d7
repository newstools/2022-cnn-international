(CNN)After five years away from the national team, Ada Hegerberg made her presence felt for Norway on her return as she scored a hat-trick in the team's 5-1 hammering of Kosovo in Women's World Cup qualifying. It took just 21 minutes for the Lyon star to reopen her account with the national team, before scoring her second just two minutes later. Hegerberg completed her hat-trick on the hour mark, with Frida Maanum and Celin Bizet Ildhusøy also getting on the score sheet. Erëleta Memeti scored the only goal of the game for Kosovo. READ: As a female footballer it's 'impossible to not be standing for equality,' says Ada Hegerberg Hegerberg last played for Norway at Euro 2017 -- where the much-fancied Norwegians exited at the group stage -- before announcing she would no longer represent her country. The 2018 Ballon d'Or Feminin winner said her decision came down to frustrations with the way women's football was treated within the country and led to her missing the 2019 World Cup in France. Hegerberg's return is certainly timely for Norway, who will be hoping the presence of their star forward, widely considered one of the most clinical finishers in the women's game, can lead them to glory at this summer's European Championships. The 26-year-old now boasts an impressive 41 goals in 67 appearances for the national team, as Norway sits top of Group F after six matches of World Cup qualifying.
