We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time. "Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you." Manchester United tweeted their support for the grieving football player: "Your pain is our pain, @Cristiano Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time." A tweet from the English Premier League reads: "The thoughts and condolences of everyone at the Premier League are with you and your family, Cristiano."

The doting dad also shares his son, Cristiano Jr., 11, with a former partner who has never been publicly named. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.
