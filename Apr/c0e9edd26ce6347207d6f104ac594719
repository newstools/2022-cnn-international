(CNN)Kim Kardashian did not see love coming with Pete Davidson. In a conversation for Hoda Kotb's "Making Space" podcast, Kardashian explained that she'd been single for about 10 months before she was ready to date again. "I think that, you know, sometimes things happen when you just least expect it. It was the last thing that I was really planning on," she said, "And so when it did happen, we were kind of, like, 'Oh, my God, I wasn't planning on this. And this isn't even what I was thinking of,' and it just makes it that much sweeter and so much more fun." In February 2021, Kardashian filed for divorce from Kanye West. Kardashian and Davidson appeared in a "Saturday Night Live" sketch together last fall where they shared a kiss. They became Instagram official in March. "I definitely took my time," Kardashian said. "I took, you know, 10 months or something before I dated or talked to anyone. And I just wanted that time to really figure out and go through the motions: 'Am I making the right decision? How do I feel about this?' So once I went through all of the motions, I finally was, like, 'OK, guys, I am so ready to meet someone.' And I randomly did." Despite their very public relationship. Kardashian says she is keeping some aspects of her time with Davidson private. "I do think that I am holding, you know, a little bit more close to my heart on certain aspects of my relationship with Pete, and it feels good just to know that, like, we have this connection and we have our little bubble of a relationship world that we live in that, like, not a lot of people know about," she said. For now, Kardashian said just being with Davidson puts a smile on her face. "We were driving in the car yesterday and I just, like, looked at him and I was like, 'Thank you.' And he was like, 'What?' And I was like, 'For running errands with me, like, this is so much fun just to, like, go to a doctor's appointment or go to the dentist and just, like, run errands. I'm having so much fun.'"
