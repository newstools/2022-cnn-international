(CNN)The original sk8r girl herself, Avril Lavigne, is heading to the altar. The Canadian singer announced Thursday that she's engaged to fellow musician Mod Sun, who proposed to Lavigne in Paris at the end of March. Lavigne, known for hits like "Sk8er Boi," gushed that the proposal was "perfect" in an exclusive interview with People: The two were on a boat in the Seine River with a clear view of the Eiffel Tower. Champagne flowed, a violinist played -- and yet Lavigne said the proposal was a "total surprise." Sun (whose real name is Derek Smith) shared photos of the proposal on Instagram with a poetic caption: "The day we met I knew you were the one. Together forever til our days are done." Lavigne and Sun met while working on her latest album, "Love Sux," which maintains the punk-pop aesthetic of Lavigne's earlier work. They "had a very strong unstoppable connection" within the first week of writing together, the "Girlfriend" singer said. "I look forward to having fun, creating, working together, touring together, growing together," Lavigne told People. (Lavigne begins touring at the end of April, with Mod Sun as one of her supporting acts.) Lavigne has been married twice before: To Deryck Whibley of Sum 41 and then to Nickelback frontman Chad Kroeger. Mod Sun previously dated former Disney actor Bella Thorne.
