(CNN)The Grammys are happening this Sunday -- a little later than usual -- but happening nonetheless! Pushed from January due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, the 64th Grammys are set in Las Vegas this year. Expect performances from Gen Z stars and nominees Lil Nas X, Olivia Rodrigo and perennial winner Billie Eilish, as well as appearances from Silk Sonic (that's Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak's group), John Legend and Carrie Underwood.

(Sorry, red carpet fans -- looks like "60 Minutes" is airing beforehand. You may have to get your fix via E! or another channel.) If you don't have cable If you're a cord cutter who subscribes to live TV services like YouTube TV or Hulu + Live TV, you should be able to access the Grammys through those apps.

If you have internet access You can watch the Grammys' Premiere Ceremony, at which most of the night's awards are presented.
