(CNN)Clea Shearer, an expert organizer and one of the stars of Netflix's "Get Organized with The Home Edit," has an aggressive form of breast cancer, she announced Thursday. Shearer broke the news on Instagram, writing that she first found a lump in late February and is scheduled to have a double mastectomy on Friday. "I had to request a mammogram from my general doctor, which led to an ultrasound, and then an emergency triple biopsy," she wrote. "I have two tumors, 1 cm each, that are aggressive and fast moving - but I caught it early. Had I not taken this upon myself, I would be in a completely different situation right now." Shearer encouraged others to regularly perform self-examinations and prioritize their health, noting that the tumors formed when she was under 40 years old and without a family history of breast cancer. "Even if cancer feels improbable, it's still very possible," she wrote. Shearer and business partner Joanna Teplin  founded their popular organizing business, The Home Edit, in 2015. "Get Organized with The Home Edit," a celebrity home organizational show, debuted on Netflix in 2020, featuring stars like Drew Barrymore and Chris Pratt. It has quickly become a hit on the platform, even launching a line of home organization tools with Walmart earlier this year. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the world, with about 2.3 million new cases in 2020 alone, according to a report published in the CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians last year.
