(CNN)A Florida man has won back a world record after watching "Spider-Man: No Way Home" 292 times. Ramiro Alanis previously broke the record for "most cinema productions attended of the same film" in 2019, after watching "Avengers: Endgame" 191 times. But in 2021, Arnaud Klein beat him out by watching "Kaamelott: First Installment" 204 times, according to a news release from Guinness World Records. To win back the title, Alanis spent a total of 720 hours, or 30 days, watching the latest installment in the "Spider-Man" saga between between December 16, 2021 and March 15, 2022. For the first few weeks of his record attempt, he watched five back-to-back screenings each day. Alanis estimates that he spent around $3,400 on movie tickets in total over the three months it took to set the record.   Alanis pursued the record in honor of his late grandmother, Juany, according to Guinness. "She was my #1 supporter and I want to remain the record holder," he said in the news release. The terms of the record dictate that the "movie must be watched independently of any other activity" -- so Alanis couldn't take a nap, use his phone, or even go to the bathroom while watching the film. What's more, Alanis juggled viewings of the film with family and work obligations. Hundreds of viewings has made Alanis an expert in the film's script, telling Guinness that he can "pretty much recite the dialogue along with the movie." The film features Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Zendaya as MJ; the two face off against Marvel villains. The blockbuster also brought back Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who both previously played Spider-Man. Thanks to Alanis and other viewers, "Spider-Man: No Way Home" has made over $1 billion in global sales.
