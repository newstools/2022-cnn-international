You can read a version of this article in Spanish on CNNE.com. (CNN)Rosalía is about to embark on an ambitious world tour that will take her to 15 countries, among them, the United States. The US leg of the "MOTOMAMI" tour starts on Sept. 15 at the MGM Music Hall in Boston and ends on Oct. 22 in Miami. The tour is produced by Live Nation. "MOTOMAMI" is Rosalía's third album, a 16-track production shaped by her good humor and musical and lyrical contradictions, something she teased us during her second single, "SAOKO." The album has been well received by critics. On Metacritic, the Catalonian singer scored a 94 for "MOTOMAMI." The production debuted at number one on Spotify's global album chart for the week of release and ranked at the top of the Latin Pop Album chart on Billboard. Tickets will go on sale this Friday.
