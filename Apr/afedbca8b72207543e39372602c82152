After a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the White House Correspondents' Dinner returns on Saturday night. President Joe Biden will be speaking at the annual event, which was started in 1921 by journalists who cover the White House. "Presidents have been attending since 1924 — with only one exception — to demonstrate a mutual respect for the First Amendment," said Steven Portnoy, president of the White House Correspondents' Association and a CBS News White House correspondent. Donald Trump is the only President who never attended while in office. But he had attended in previous years as a guest. The dinner is known for its laughs and lighthearted moments. In more recent years, they have featured a speaker — usually a comedian — roasting the commander in chief. CNN will air special coverage of the White House Correspondents' Dinner from 7-11 p.m. ET on Saturday night. It will be anchored by John Berman and Brianna Keilar in Washington, DC.
