New York (CNN Business)CNN anchor Anderson Cooper announced the birth of his second son on Thursday's "AC360" broadcast. Cooper said his newborn son's name is Sebastian Luke Maisani-Cooper. "He was 6.8 pounds at birth, and he is healthy and happy. Even his occasional hiccups are, to me, adorable," Cooper said during the broadcast. Cooper said Sebastian "mostly just sleeps and eats and he certainly poops, but he already seems like a wise and thoughtful little chap." This is Cooper's second child. His first son, Wyatt, was born in April 2020. Cooper said he is co-parenting Wyatt and Sebastian with his best friend and former partner Benjamin Maisani. Cooper said Maisani is in the process of adopting Wyatt, who will also have the last name "Maisani-Cooper." "We want to thank the amazing doctors and nurses who helped bring Sebastian into the world, and most of all thank the surrogate who carried Sebastian and gave birth to him," Cooper said. "The sacrifices she and her family — her entire family — made, and the love that they gave Sebastian this past year has been extraordinary." Cooper said he planned to take the rest of this week and next week off to be with his children.
