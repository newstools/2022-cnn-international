ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi was killed during a US raid in northwest Syria, President Joe Biden announced on Thursday, February 3. It was the biggest US raid in the country since the 2019 operation that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Qurayshi blew himself up as US forces approached his compound, Biden administration officials said, and the explosion resulted in multiple civilian casualties, though there was a discrepancy between the Biden administration and a Syrian civil defense group over how many. There were no US casualties, according to the Pentagon. "Thanks to the bravery of our troops, this horrible terrorist leader is no more," Biden said from the White House. "Knowing that terrorist had chosen to surround himself with families, including children, we made a choice to pursue a Special Forces raid at a much a greater risk to our own people rather than targeting him with an airstrike." Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
