(CNN)Austria became the first country in Europe to introduce a national Covid-19 vaccine mandate for adults on Friday after President Alexander Van der Bellen signed it into law. Austria's sweeping measures will see those without a vaccine certificate or an exemption potentially slapped with initial fines of 600 euros ($680). Checks to see if the mandate is being adhered to begin from March 15. CNN's Joseph Ataman, Camille Knight Henrik Pettersson and Niamh Kennedy contributed to this report.
