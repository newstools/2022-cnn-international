(CNN)Talk about acing it. Miguel Angel Jimenez hit two hole-in-ones in the same tournament on his way to claiming the Cologuard Classic title. In the tournament's opening round on Thursday, the Spaniard hit a hole-in-one on the seventh hole to kickstart his title charge. And Jimenez quashed any hopes of a late push to unseat him from the top of the leaderboard with his second ace of the tournament on the 178-yard par-three 14th hole on Sunday. The odds of professional golfers hitting a hole-in-one are significantly higher than your average player, but they still may go their whole career without achieving that feat. According to the National Hole-in-One Registry, the odds of a tour player hitting a hole-in-one are 3,000-to-1, while for average players they are 12,000-to-1. The 58-year-old Jimenez was awarded the traditional conquistador's helmet-shaped trophy as the winner, something he proceeded to wear in celebration. "I hit a beautiful 6-iron, it went at the hole and, ace," Jimenez said after finishing with a seven-under 65 as he reflected on his second ace. "You never think about it. You know you want to hit a good shot and put it as close as possible." The PGA Tour Champions' season features 28 events with players competing for over $62 million in total prize money.
