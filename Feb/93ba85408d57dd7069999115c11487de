(CNN)Congratulations are in order for Olympian Simone Biles and NFL player Jonathan Owens. Biles shared on social media Tuesday that the couple is now engaged. "Woke up a fiancée," she tweeted, along with a few photos with Owens as he popped the question. "I can't wait to spend forever & ever with you, you're everything I dreamed of and more! let's get married!" She shared even more photos in a post on her verified Instagram account, including video of her massive engagement ring. "The easiest yes," Biles wrote in the caption. The gold medalist and the Houston Texans football player met via the internet right before the pandemic hit. Owens told Texas Monthly in January 2021 that the shutdown (which postponed sports) created time for them to get to know each other better. "It was one of the few times in her life where everything was just shut off and she couldn't do anything," he said. "So we used it to get to know each other—really get to know each other. It created our bond and made it stronger. Now I'm so thankful."
