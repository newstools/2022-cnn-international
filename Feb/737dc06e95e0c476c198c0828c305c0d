The Screen Actors Guild Awards took place on Sunday night, honoring the best performances in film and television. The show was held at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California. Last year, there was no live show; because of Covid-19, the show and its acceptance speeches were pre-recorded. The shows "Succession" and "Ted Lasso" had the most nominations this year, with five each. Actress Helen Mirren received a lifetime achievement award.
