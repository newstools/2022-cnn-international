(CNN)The nominations for the 94th Academy Awards were announced Tuesday and included films in a wide range of genres. "The Power of the Dog" led among nominated films with 12 nods. The drama's director, Jane Campion, made history by becoming the first woman to be nominated more than once for best director. (Her previous nod was for "The Piano.") Fellow directing nominee Steven Spielberg also set a new record. As producer of "West Side Story," which earned a total of seven nominations, Spielberg has now produced 11 films nominated for best picture, a new record for the Oscars. Denzel Washington extended the record he already holds as the most nominated Black actor, earning his tenth Oscar nomination for his performance in "The Tragedy of Macbeth." (One of his nominations was for producing.) The Academy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, March 27. See below for a full list of nominees.
