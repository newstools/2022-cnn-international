The Winter Olympics kicked into full gear this week in Beijing, and we've been treated to some unforgettable moments so far. Snowboarding legend Shaun White competed for the last time Friday, finishing fourth in the halfpipe event that he won in 2006, 2010 and 2018. After falling on his third and final run, the American took off his helmet and waved goodbye to the crowd. "Snowboarding, thank you," he said after the event. "It's been the love of my life. It's been a journey. I can't wait to see where this sport goes." The gold medal went to Japan's Ayumu Hirano, who got the highest score on the very last run of the day to overtake Australia's Scotty James. On each of his three runs Friday, Hirano landed a triple cork — a three-flip trick that had never even been attempted before in an Olympic final. Switzerland's Jan Scherrer won the bronze. Here are some of the stories that made headlines over the past week, as well as some photos that caught our eye.
