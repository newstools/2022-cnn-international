"The world is shocked as Russia launches a major military offensive against Ukraine," analysts for ING wrote Thursday in a research note. "Financial markets are predictably witnessing a flight to safety and may have to price in slower growth on the further spike in energy prices," they added. Investors will watch for the West's response to Russia's aggression, which is likely to include punishing sanctions.
